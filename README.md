# WordMaster

WordMaster is a Wordle-like vocabulary learning game built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It helps you practice and improve your word-guessing skills through short, focused rounds.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (install from https://nodejs.org/) and npm must be installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Unzip the project archive (if necessary).
2. Open a terminal and change into the project folder:

```powershell
cd word-master
```

3. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

## Running the app

- Start the development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- After the dev server starts, open your browser to: `http://localhost:5173`

## Live Demo

A hosted live version is available at:

https://word-master.pages.dev

## Notes

- This project uses React + Vite for the development environment and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- If the default port `5173` is in use, Vite will choose an available port — check the terminal output for the exact URL.
